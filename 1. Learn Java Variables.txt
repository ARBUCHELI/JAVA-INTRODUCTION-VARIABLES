* 1. Learn Java: Variables
--------------------------
	* Introduction
	--------------
		We store information in variables, named locations in memory.

		Naming a piece of information allows us to use that name later, accessing the information we stored.

		Variables also give context and meaning to the data we’re storing. The value 42 could be someone’s age, a weight in pounds, or the number of orders placed. With a name, we 
		know the value 42 is age, weightInPounds, or numOrdersPlaced.

		In Java, we specify the type of information we’re storing. Primitive data types are types of data built-in to the Java system. The three main primitive types we’ll cover 
		are int, double, and boolean; this lesson will introduce these built-in types and more.

		We must declare a variable to reference it within our program. Declaring a variable requires that we specify the type and name:

			// datatype variableName
			int age;
			double salaryRequirement;
			boolean isEmployed;

		The names of the variables above are age, salaryRequirement, and isEmployed.

		These variables don’t have any associated value. To assign a value to a variable, we use the assignment operator =:

		age = 85;
