* 1. Learn Java: Variables
--------------------------
* Introduction
--------------
	We store information in variables, named locations in memory.

	Naming a piece of information allows us to use that name later, accessing the information we stored.

	Variables also give context and meaning to the data we’re storing. The value 42 could be someone’s age, a weight in pounds, or the number of orders placed. With a name, we 
	know the value 42 is age, weightInPounds, or numOrdersPlaced.

	In Java, we specify the type of information we’re storing. Primitive data types are types of data built-in to the Java system. The three main primitive types we’ll cover 
	are int, double, and boolean; this lesson will introduce these built-in types and more.

	We must declare a variable to reference it within our program. Declaring a variable requires that we specify the type and name:

		// datatype variableName
		int age;
		double salaryRequirement;
		boolean isEmployed;

	The names of the variables above are age, salaryRequirement, and isEmployed.

	These variables don’t have any associated value. To assign a value to a variable, we use the assignment operator =:

		age = 85;

	Now, age has a value of 85. When code is used to represent a fixed value, like 85, it is referred to as a literal.

	It’s also common to declare a variable and assign it a value in one line!

	For example, to assign 2011 to a variable named yearCodecademyWasFounded of type int, we write:

		int yearCodecademyWasFounded = 2011;

Creator.java
------------
public class Creator {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
    String name = "James Gosling";
    int yearCreated = 1995;
    System.out.println(name);
    System.out.println(yearCreated);
	}
}

* ints
------
	The first type of data we will store is the whole number. Whole numbers are very common in programming. You often see them used to store ages, or maximum sizes, or the number of 
	times some code has been run, among many other uses.

	In Java, whole numbers are stored in the int primitive data type.

	ints hold positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero. They do not store fractions or numbers with decimals in them.

	The int data type allows values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647, inclusive.

	To declare a variable of type int, we use the int keyword before the variable name:

		// int variable declaration
		int yearJavaWasCreated;
		// assignment
		yearJavaWasCreated = 1996;
		// declaration and assignment
		int numberOfPrimitiveTypes = 8;
