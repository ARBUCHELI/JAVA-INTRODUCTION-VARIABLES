** 5. Casting and Converting
----------------------------
* Learn how to transform a value of one data type to another in Java.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	If you aren’t familiar with the folk tale The Little Glass Slipper, a magical entity casts a spell that transforms the protagonist’s clothing type from work attire to formal wear. 
	As programmers, we can do something similar by transforming a value of one primitive data type to another using type casting.

	* Numerical-Based Casting
	-------------------------
	When we use casting to change the data type of number-based values, it can impact how much data the value holds. If there is less data in the value after casting, it’s considered 
	narrow type casting. If the value contains more data after casting, it’s classified as widening type casting.

	In order to cast, we need to use a casting operator to alert the compiler that we want to create a temporary value that is a converted data type. Two casting operators we will 
	focus on are (int) and (double).

	* Narrow Type Casting
	---------------------
	To convert a double to an int, we would place the casting operator (int) in front of a value we would like to convert.

	For example:

		double numDouble = 12.99;
		System.out.println("Double value: " + numDouble);
		// convert a double to int
		int numInt = (int) numDouble;
		System.out.println("Int value: " + numInt);

	This would output:

		Double value: 12.99
		Int value: 12

	When we convert a double to an int, the digits to the right of the decimal point are truncated. Of course, when we see a value like 12.99, we know that it’s numerically closer in 
	value to 13 than it is to 12. Java does not automatically round the value. If we want to round our positive value to the nearest integer, we can use (int)(value + 0.5); in the 
	case that our number is negative, we would instead use (int)(x - 0.5):

		double numDouble = 12.99;
		System.out.println("Double value: " + numDouble);
		// convert a double to an int rounded to nearest value
		int numInt = (int) (numDouble + 0.5);
		System.out.println("Int value: " + numInt);

	This would output:

		Double value: 12.99
		Int value: 13

	Fill in the blank
		Fill in the blank so that the following program outputs 25.

			double num1 = 24.72;
			int num2 = (int)(num1 + 0.5);
			System.out.println(num2);
 
	👏
	You got it!

	It’s important to be aware that there are limitations to when working with whole number, or int, values in Java. There is a limited amount of data that can be stored in an int — 4 
	bytes. We can use Integer.MIN_VALUE and Integer.MAX_VALUE to find the minimum and maximum value of an int:

		System.out.println("Min: " + Integer.MIN_VALUE); // Prints: Min: -2147483648
		System.out.println("Max: " + Integer.MAX_VALUE); // Prints: Max: 2147483647

	If we created an expression that evaluated a value outside of this range, we would be faced with an integer overflow, which could result in an error or having an incorrect value 
	that’s within the allowed range.

	Coding question
	---------------
	Try outputting these int values that exist outside the appropriate range. When you run the program, consider the following questions:

		. Which variable causes an error?
		. Which variable outputs an incorrect value?

	You will need to comment out the variable that is causing an error in order to see the variable with the incorrect value.

	class IntegerRange {
  		public static void main(String[] args) {
    			// the variable a is declared with a value outside the range
    			//int a = 3147483647;
    			//System.out.println(a);

    			// the sum of the following expression is outside the appropriate int range
    			int b = 2147483645 + 3;
    			System.out.println(b);
  		}
	}

	* Widening Type Casting
	-----------------------
	If we were to use casting to change an int value to a double, we’d need to implement the (double) casting operator in our code:

		int numInt = 9;
		System.out.println("Int value: " + numInt);
		// convert an int to a double
		System.out.println("Double value: " + (double)numInt);

	This will output:

		Int value: 9
		Double value: 9.0

	In the program above, we did not change the type of numInt in the second print statement; instead, we created a temporary value when we casted numInt as a double. If we wanted to 
	permanently save that value, we could create a new variable like double newValue = (double)numInt.

	Unlike in narrow type casting, an int value can automatically get cast to a double value in Java code. For example, this occurrence can happen when we create an arithmetic 
	expression that references a double and an int:

		System.out.println(100.0 / 5); // Prints: 20.0

	Java automatically cast the value as a double even though one of the values in the expression was an int.

	We can also cast the value of an expression as a double even if both values in the expression are ints. To do this, we’ll place (double) in front of an expression that is 
	contained in its own set of parentheses like so:

		System.out.println((double)(100 / 5)); // Prints: 20.0

	Multiple choice
	---------------
		Does the following code show narrow type casting or widening type casting?

		System.out.println((double)(13 * 5));

		Asw/ Widening type casting

	* Converting Integer and String Values
	--------------------------------------
	In Java, we can convert an int value to a String value and vice versa. This doesn’t count as casting because a String is not a primitive type value, but it can be useful to know 
	how to perform this conversion. To change the value of an int into a String, we need to use the valueOf() method from the String class:

		int numInt = 15;
		System.out.println("Int value: " + numInt);
		// Convert int value to String
		String numString = String.valueOf(numInt);
		System.out.println("String value: " + numString);

	This will output:

		Int value: 15
		String value: 15

	Even though the output looks the same, the second output shows us a String value instead of an int value.

	If we wanted to turn a String value into an int, we would need to call the parseInt() method from the Integer class. In order to call this method, we will reference the class 
	Integer and then call the method parseInt() by using the dot operator (.). Altogether, this call would look like this Integer.parseInt(argumentValue).

	Let’s see this in action by converting the String value "12" into an int:

		String numString = "12";
		// convert String to int
		int numInt = Integer.parseInt(numString);
		System.out.println("The int value: " + numInt); // Prints: The int value: 12
		// we can now use the value like any other int
		numInt++;
		System.out.println(numInt); // Prints: 13

	Note that the value in the String MUST contain a numerical value in order to convert it into an int. If we tried to run the code Integer.parseInt(“hello”);, we would receive an 
	error.

	Multiple choice
	---------------
	True or False: A String can be converted into an int using the String.valueOf() method.

	Asw/ False

	* Conclusions
	-------------
	Great job reaching the end of this article. Let’s go over what we learned:

		. Casting is the process of converting a value of one primitive data type to another.

		. Narrow type casting occurs when the amount of data held a value decreases after conversion.

		. To convert a double into an int, we must use the (int) casting operator.

		. Narrow type casting does not automatically occur in Java and must be done manually by the programmer.

		. Widening type casting occurs when a value increases how much data it holds after casting.

		. To convert an int to a double, we need to use the (double) casting operator.

		. Widening type casting can occur automatically in Java. String values can be converted to an int using the parseInt() method from the Integer class.

		. An int value can be converted into a String using the valueOf() method from the String class.

	Multiple choice
	---------------
	What will the following program output?

	String x = "9";
	System.out.println((double)(Integer.parseInt(x)/3));

	Asw/ 3.0
